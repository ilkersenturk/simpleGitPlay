To get an idea of what is possible with\n    this technique, see these 100% hand-made websites:\n\n<ul>\n\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory\">The History of\n        Computing at Columbia University 1890-2005</a>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~fdc/family/dcmall.html\">The Washington\n        DC Nation Mall in World War II</a>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~fdc/family/hallshill.html\">Arlington,\n        Virginia, 1956-61: The Hall's Hill Segregation Wall</a>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"contents\">CONTENTS</h3>\n\n<ol>\n    <li><a href=\"#basics\">Creating a Web Page</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#syntax\">HTML Syntax</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#chars\">Special Characters</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#convert\">Converting Plain Text to HTML</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#effects\">Effects</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#lists\">Lists</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#links\">Links</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#tables\">Tables</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#viewing\">Viewing your Web page</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#install\">Installing your Web Page on the Internet</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#more\">Where to go from here</a>\n    <li><a href=\"#fluid\">Postscript: Cell Phones</a>\n</ol>\n<p>\n\n    You can create a Web page on your desktop computer but nobody can see it but\n    you.  If your want other people to be able to see your Web pages, you need\n    an account on a computer that has a Web server.  Nowadays most people have\n    their own computers on their desks, but normally they don't have Web servers\n    and anyway you don't want the whole world coming into your desktop computer\n    to see your web page because (a) it's not designed for that, and (b) who\n    knows what else they might see.  And (c) for security reasons, Web servers\n    should be managed by professionals.  Most institutions have big central\n    shared computers for this purpose, which usually have\n    a <a href=\"http://kermitproject.org/unix.html\">Unix</a>-like operating\n    system such as Linux.  You need an account on one of these so you can put\n    your web pages there.  If you don't have access to such a computer, you can get\n    a low-cost account on a service like <a href=\"http://panix.com\">Panix.com</a>.\n\n<p>\n\n    You can still create Web pages on your own computer and look at them with\n    your computer's Web browser, but for other people to see them, you have to\n    upload them to the \"big\" computer that has the Web browser.  The rest of\n    this document is about how to create your first Web page.\n\n<h3 id=\"basics\">1. Creating a Web Page</h3>\n\nThis page was typed by hand.  Anybody can do this, you don't need any\nspecial \"web creation\" tools or HTML editors, and the pages you make can be\nviewed from any browser.  To see how this page was made, choose\n<b>View Source</b> (or View Page Source, or View Document Source) in your\nbrowser's menu (or &mdash; in at least Chrome and Firefox &mdash; Ctrl-U on\nyour keyboard).  A simple web page like this one is just plain text with\nHTML commands (markup) mixed in.  HTML commands (properly called \"tags\")\nthemselves are plain text.\n\n<p>\n\n    When you're just learning and want to experiment, you can do everything on\n    your PC.  Create a new directory (\"folder\") for your website, and then put\n    the web-page files (HTML plus any pictures) in it.  Use NotePad or other\n    plain-text editor (not word processor) on your PC to create your \"home page\",\n    a file named\n    <span class=\"tt\">index.html</span>, which you can view locally with your Web\n    browser.  (You can also use a word processors such as Word or WordPad if you\n    save in \"plain text\", \"text\", \"text document\", or \"text document MS-DOS\n    format\".)\n    <a href=\"#install\">Later</a> I'll explain how you can install your web site on\n    the Internet.\n\n<p>\n\n    Once you've made your \"home page\" (index.html) you can add more pages to\n    your site, and your home page can link to them.\n\n<h3 id=\"syntax\">2. HTML Syntax</h3>\n\nWeb pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).  HTML has three\nspecial characters:\n<span class=\"tt\">&lt;</span>, <span class=\"tt\">&amp;</span>, <span class=\"tt\">&gt;</span>.\nAn HTML command is enclosed in <span class=\"tt\">&lt;...&gt;</span>, for example\n<span class=\"tt\">&lt;p&gt;</span>, which is a paragraph separator, or <span class=\"tt\">&lt;b&gt;</span>\n(\"begin bold\") and <span class=\"tt\">&lt;/b&gt;</span> (\"end bold\").  So the following\nHTML text:\n\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    <blockquote>\n<pre>\nThis sentence contains &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.\n</pre>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n\nproduces:\n\n<p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    <blockquote>\n        This sentence contains <b>bold</b> text.\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>\n\n    A Web page starts with a series of HTML commands, and ends with\n    a few more.  The contents go in between:\n\n<p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    <blockquote>\n<pre>\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;META charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n&lt;META name=\"viewport\"\n content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Sample Web Page&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n</pre>\n        <p>\n            <i>(Contents go here)</i>\n        <p>\n        <pre>\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>\n\n    The first line (<span class=\"tt\">DOCTYPE</span>) specifies which markup\n    language the page uses\n    (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\">HTML</a> = Hypertext Markup\n    Language); just copy this line.  The next\n    line, <span class=\"tt\">&lt;html&nbsp;lang=\"en\"&gt;</span>, starts the page\n    and specifies\n    the (human) language it is written in (language codes are specified\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes\">here</a>),\n    and is matched by the line\n    <span class=\"tt\">&lt;/html&gt;</span>, which closes the\n    page.  <span class=\"tt\">&lt;head&gt;</span> starts the heading, which\n    contains a title to be displayed on the browser's title bar and a\n    declaration of the character set (nowadays it should always be\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\">UTF-8</a>) and the \"viewport\"\n    line which is a compulsory adaptation for cell phones, \"smart\" watches, etc.\n    <span class=\"tt\">&lt;/head&gt;</span> closes the heading.  The head can also\n    contain other items such as style parameters that you can learn about later;\n    for example by asking Google (\"HTML how do&nbsp;I change the font size?\").\n\n<p>\n\n    The <span class=\"tt\">&lt;body&gt;</span> tag starts the body of the\n    document, is closed by <span class=\"tt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span> tag.\n\n<p>\n\n    As you can see, most HTML commands come in begin-end pairs:\n    <span class=\"tt\">&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</span>,\n    <span class=\"tt\">&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</span>, etc.  The closing part of the command\n    has a slash (<span class=\"tt\">/</span>) between the <span class=\"tt\">&lt;</span> and the first letter of\n    the command.\n\n<p>\n\n    Blank lines and line breaks are ignored.  The browser automatically \"flows\"\n    your text into lines and paragraphs that fit in its window.  Paragraphs must\n    be separated by <span class=\"tt\">&lt;p&gt;</span>.  Line breaks can be\n    forced by <span class=\"tt\">&lt;br&gt;</span>.\n\n<p>\n<dl>\n    <dt><i>Example for Windows:</i>\n\n    <dd>Use the mouse to copy the HTML above into NotePad.  Then save the file\n        (<i>File</i>&nbsp;<span class=\"tt\">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<i>Save&nbsp;As...</i>)\n        in your Web directory as <span class=\"tt\">index.html</span>.  Suppose your Windows username\n        is Olga.  Then (depending on which version of Windows you have) this might\n        be:\n\n        <div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n            <blockquote>\n<pre>\n<span class=\"tt\">C:\\Users\\Olga\\Desktop\\Web\\index.html</span>\n</pre>\n            </blockquote>\n        </div>\n\n        Now to see your new web page, just double-click on the Web folder and\n        then double-click on <span class=\"tt\">index.html</span>.\n</dl>\n<p>\n\n    Now you're ready to start adding \"content\" to your web page.  Go back to\n    NotePad and replace the title and \"(Contents go here)\" with whatever you\n    want.  Any time you want to see the result, use\n    <i>File</i>&nbsp;<span class=\"tt\">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<i>Save</i> in NotePad and then\n    click the Reload button on your browser.\n\n<p>\n\n    The next sections tell how to achieve different kinds of effects.\n\n<h3 id=\"chars\">3. Special Characters</h3>\n\nHTML special \"character entities\" start with ampersand (<span class=\"tt\">&amp;</span>) and\nend with semicolon (<span class=\"tt\">;</span>), like \"<span class=\"tt\">&amp;euro;</span>\" = \"&euro;\".  The\never-popular \"no-break space\" is <span class=\"tt\">&amp;nbsp;</span>.  There are special\nentity names for accented Latin letters and other West European special\ncharacters such as:\n\n<p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    <blockquote>\n        <table border>\n            <tr>\n                <td><span class=\"tt\">&amp;auml;</span>\n                <td>a-umlaut\n                <td>&nbsp;&auml;&nbsp;\n\n            <tr>\n                <td><span class=\"tt\">&amp;Auml;</span>\n                <td>A-umlaut\n                <td>&nbsp;&Auml;&nbsp;\n\n            <tr>\n                <td><span class=\"tt\">&amp;aacute;</span>\n                <td>a-acute\n                <td>&nbsp;&aacute;&nbsp;\n\n            <tr>\n                <td><span class=\"tt\">&amp;agrave;</span>\n                <td>a-grave\n                <td>&nbsp;&agrave;&nbsp;\n\n            <tr>\n                <td><span class=\"tt\">&amp;ntilde;</span>\n                <td>n-tilde\n                <td>&nbsp;&ntilde;&nbsp;\n\n            <tr>\n                <td><span class=\"tt\">&amp;szlig;</span>\n                <td>German double-s\n                <td>&nbsp;&szlig;&nbsp;\n\n            <tr>\n                <td><span class=\"tt\">&amp;thorn;</span>\n                <td>Icelandic thorn\n                <td>&nbsp;&thorn;&nbsp;\n        </table>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>\n\n    (The table above is shown in the basic, default style of HTML.  Of course\n    there are many ways to customize the appearance of tables; more\n    about this <a href=\"#tables\">below</a>.\n\n<p>\n\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    Examples:\n\n    <dl>\n        <dt>For <b>Spanish</b> you would need:\n        <dd><span class=\"tt\">&amp;Aacute;</span> (&Aacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;aacute;</span> (&aacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;Eacute;</span> (&Eacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;eacute;</span> (&eacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;Iacute;</span> (&Iacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;iacute;</span> (&iacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;Oacute;</span> (&Oacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;oacute;</span> (&oacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;Uacute;</span> (&uacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;uacute;</span> (&uacute;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;Uuml;</span> (&Uuml;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;uuml;</span> (&uuml;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;Ntilde;</span> (&Ntilde;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;ntilde;</span> (&ntilde;);\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;iquest;</span> (&iquest;);\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;iexcl;</span> (&iexcl;).<br>\n            Example: A&ntilde;orar&aacute;n = <span class=\"tt\">A&amp;ntilde;orar&amp;aacute;n</span>.\n\n            <p>\n\n        <dt>For <b>German</b> you would need:\n        <dd><span class=\"tt\">&amp;Auml;</span> (&Auml;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;auml;</span> (&auml;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;Ouml;</span> (&Ouml;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;ouml;</span> (&ouml;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;Uuml;</span> (&uuml;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;uuml;</span> (&uuml;),\n            <span class=\"tt\">&amp;szlig;</span> (&szlig;).<br>\n            Example: Gr&uuml;&szlig;e aus K&ouml;ln = <span class=\"tt\">Gr&amp;uuml;&amp;szlig;e aus K&amp;ouml;ln</span>.\n\n    </dl>\n</div>\n\n<a href=\"entities.html\">CLICK HERE</a>\nfor a complete list.  When the page encoding is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\">UTF-8</a>, which is\nrecommended, you can also enter any character at all, Roman,\nCyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek. Japanese,\netc, either as numeric entities or (if you have a way to type them) directly\nfrom the keyboard.\n\n<p>\n\n    And remember: if you want to\n    include <span class=\"tt\">&lt;</span>, <span class=\"tt\">&amp;</span>,\n    or <span class=\"tt\">&gt;</span> literally in text to be displayed, you have\n    to write <span class=\"tt\">&amp;lt;</span>,\n    <span class=\"tt\">&amp;amp;</span>, <span class=\"tt\">&amp;gt;</span>, respectively.\n\n<h3 id=\"convert\">4. Converting Plain Text to HTML</h3>\n\nIf you have a plain text file that you want to convert to HTML, load the\nfile into a plain-text editor and then follow these steps.\n\n<p>\n<ol>\n    <li>Change all occurrences of \"<span class=\"tt\">&amp;</span>\" to \"<span class=\"tt\">&amp;amp;</span>\".\n    <li>Change all occurrences of \"<span class=\"tt\">&lt;</span>\" to \"<span class=\"tt\">&amp;lt;</span>\".\n    <li>Change all occurrences of \"<span class=\"tt\">&gt;</span>\" to \"<span class=\"tt\">&amp;gt;</span>\".\n    <li>Change any accented letters to HTML entity names (previous section)*.\n    <li>Put \"<span class=\"tt\">&lt;p&gt;</span>\" between each paragraph.\n    <li>Insert the standard prolog at the top, substituting an appropriate title.\n    <li>Add <span class=\"tt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span> and\n        <span class=\"tt\">&lt;/html&gt;</span> at the end.\n    <li>Save the result as <span class=\"tt\"><i>xxx</i>.html</span>, where\n        <span class=\"tt\"><i>xxx</i></span> is the part of the original file's name\n        before the dot, or whatever-else-you-want-to-call-it.html.\n</ol>\n<p>\n\n    If you are a <a href=\"http://kermitproject.org/about.html\">Kermit</a> user, you\n    can find a script to convert plain text to HTML\n    <a href=\"http://kermitproject.org/html.html\">HERE</a>.\n\n<p>\n\n    If the text contains lists, tables, or other structures, read on.\n\n<p>\n\n    If you have a Microsoft Word document you want to convert to HTML, and your\n    copy of Word does not allow the file to be \"Saved As\" HTML, then save it as\n    plain text and follow the same instructions.  In this case you lose the\n    \"richness\" (bold, italics, font changes, etc) when you save the file, and\n    will have to put the effects back by hand (next section).\n\n<p>\n<table style=\"font-size:80%; width:66%; border-top:1px solid black;\">\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:18px\">*\n        <td> Not necessary if your text is already encoded as UTF-8.  If it's not\n            UTF-8, you can identify the encoding in the &lt;META charset=\"...\"&gt;\n            directive, but this topic is a bit advanced for this simple tutorial.\n</table>\n\n<h3 id=\"effects\">5. Effects</h3>\n\nThe rest of this document shows some of what you can do with simple HTML\ncommands, but I don't explain how to do it.  To see that, just tell your\nbrowser to <b>View Source</b> and compare the HTML in the source window with\nthe result in the original window.\n\n<p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    <blockquote>\n\n        <i>Note:</i> In this and the following\n        sections, I use some \"deprecated\" features from earlier HTML versions\n        because they are easier for beginners to learn (for\n        example <span class=\"tt\">&lt;big&gt;...&lt;/big&gt;</span> versus\n        <span class=\"tt\" style=\"white-space:pre\">\n&lt;span style=\"font-size:120%\"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</span>).\n\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n\n    <b>This sentence is bold.</b> <i>This sentence is\n    in italics.</i> <b><i>This sentence is in bold italics.</i></b> <span class=\"tt\">This\nsentence is in typewriter font.</span> This sentence has <u>underlined\n    words</u> and <u><b>underlined bold words</b></u>.\n\n    <font color=\"blue\">This</font>\n    <font color=\"red\">sentence</font>\n    <font color=\"green\">has</font>\n    <font color=\"brown\">colored</font>\n    <font color=\"magenta\">words</font>.\n\n    This sentence has <big>big\n    words.</big> This one has <big><big>very big words</big></big>.

Environments such as blockquotes,\n    lists, etc, that have a beginning and an end always use paired commands like\n    <span class=\"tt\">&lt;<i>blah</i>&gt;...&lt;<i>/blah</i>&gt;</span>.\n\n    <p>\n    <blockquote>\n\n        This is a blockquote inside another blockquote, which shows how HTML\n        environments can be \"nested\".\n\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n\n        Here we are back in the first blockquote again.\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n    And here we are back outside of the first blockquote.\n\n<h3 id=\"lists\">6.

In other\n        words, don't mess with the file, just send it as-is.

This should be\n        used with plain-text files, especially when transferring them between\n        computers with different file formats or operating systems, such as VMS and\n        Unix, or Unix and Windows.  It converts the file's format and character-set\n        (if necessary) so the received file is usable on the destination computer.\n\n</dl>\n<p>\n\n    You can have lists within lists:\n\n<p>\n<ol>\n    <li>A gromet\n    <li>A widget\n    <li>A framus, which consists of the following components:\n        <ul>\n            <li>A doohickey.\n            <li>A veeblefetzer -- these come in several colors:\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Purple\n                    <li>Purple\n                    <li>Purple\n                </ol>\n            <li>A whatchamacallit.\n        </ul>\n    <li>A doodad.\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n\n    And you can have ordered lists that use letters instead of numbers:\n\n<p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n    <li>Pennies\n    <li>Nickels\n    <li>Dimes\n    <li>Quarters\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"links\">7. Links</h3>\n\nLinks can be internal within a Web page (like to\nthe <a href=\"#contents\">Table of Contents</a> at the top), or they\ncan be to external web pages or pictures on the same website, or they\ncan be to websites, pages, or pictures anywhere else in the world.\n\n<p>\n\n    Here is a link to the <a href=\"http://www.kermitproject.org/\">Kermit\n    Project home page</a>.  And here is what the HTML looks like:\n\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    <blockquote>\n<pre>\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.kermitproject.org/\"&gt;\nKermit Project home page\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</pre>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>\n\n    The part inside the quotes is called the URL (Uniform Resource Locator).\n    Here is a link to <a href=\"#lists\">Section 6</a> of the page you are\n    reading, and the HTML:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n&lt;a href=\"#lists\"&gt;Section 6&lt;/a&gt;\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe \"#\" indicates an internal section ID, in this case:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n&lt;h3 id=\"lists\"&gt;6.

Tables</h3>\n\nHere's a simple table with some headings and a few rows:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote style=\"overflow-x:auto;\">\n    <table>\n        <tr>            <!-- start table row -->\n            <th>Heading A   <!-- table heading -->\n            <th>Heading B\n            <th>Heading C\n        <tr>            <!-- start another row -->\n            <td>Cell 1A\n            <td>Cell 1B\n            <td>Cell 1C\n        <tr>            <!-- start another row -->\n            <td>Cell 2A\n            <td>Cell 2B\n            <td>Cell 2C\n        <tr>            <!-- start another row -->\n            <td>Cell 3A\n            <td>Cell 3B\n            <td>Cell 3C\n    </table>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n    Same table again but with borders:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n\n    <table border>\n        <tr>            <!-- start table row -->\n            <th>Heading A   <!-- table heading -->\n            <th>Heading B\n            <th>Heading C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 1A\n            <td>Cell 1B\n            <td>Cell 1C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 2A\n            <td>Cell 2B\n            <td>Cell 2C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 3A\n            <td>Cell 3B\n            <td>Cell 3C\n    </table>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n    The appearance with double borders is the default (and therefore easiest)\n    table style.  You can\n    use <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\">table\n    attributes</a> to change the appearance.\n\n<p>\n\n    Here's the same table again but with Column C right-adjusted:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n\n    <table border>\n        <tr>            <!-- start table row -->\n            <th>Heading A   <!-- table heading -->\n            <th>Heading B\n            <th>Heading C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 1A\n            <td>Cell 1B\n            <td align=\"right\">Cell 1C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 2A\n            <td>Cell 2B\n            <td align=\"right\">Cell 2C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 3A\n            <td>Cell 3B\n            <td align=\"right\">Cell 3C\n    </table>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"tables\">\n\n    And finally, here it again with some \"style\" parameters applied to\n    get rid of the ugly double borders, which you can see in the\n    <tt>&lt;style&gt;</tt> section of the\n    <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> at the top of this page, if you \"view source\".\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n    <table class=\"compact\">\n        <tr>            <!-- start table row -->\n            <th>Heading A   <!-- table heading -->\n            <th>Heading B\n            <th>Heading C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 1A\n            <td>Cell 1B\n            <td align=\"right\">Cell 1C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 2A\n            <td>Cell 2B\n            <td align=\"right\">Cell 2C\n        <tr>\n            <td>Cell 3A\n            <td>Cell 3B\n            <td align=\"right\">Cell 3C\n    </table>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n    So with just three lines added to the\n    <tt>&lt;style&gt;</tt> section at the top of the page, you can make\n    all your tables look better.\n\n<h3 id=\"viewing\">9. Viewing Your Web Page</h3>\n\nAnyway, back to basics.  If you make a simple <tt>index.html</tt>\nin your Web directory like:\n\n<blockquote style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n<pre>\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;My first web page&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;META charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n&lt;META name=\"viewport\"\n content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h2&gt;\nAnd this is some text.\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nThen if you double-click on <tt>index.html</tt>, it will open in your\nWeb browser.\n\n<p>\n\n    Now you can work on your page's <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>: add more text,\n    add some images, add some links, add subheadings, some lists, some tables,\n    whatever you want.  Each time you make a change, reload the page in your\n    browser (usually done by clicking on the <b>&#x27f3</b> symbol, or typing\n    Ctrl-R).\n\n<p>\n\n    By the way, a web page can have any name at all, it doesn't have to be\n    index.html.  Index.html is a special name that is used for the \"home page\"\n    of a website.  To open a web page that has some other name, right-click on\n    the filename and then choose \"Open with...\"; then click on your Web\n    browser's name.\n\n<h3 id=\"install\">10. Installing Your Web Page on the Internet</h3>\n\nHow to put your web page on the Internet depends on your Internet Service\nProvider (ISP).  At Columbia University, each user has a \"shell account\" on\nthe central server, which runs a Unix-based operating system, and which you\ncan access with a terminal emulator such as <a\n        href=\"http://kermitproject.org/\">Kermit</a>.  Here's an example that\napplies to Columbia University's web server, showing how to upload your\nfiles from Windows:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n    <i>\n\n        There are easier ways to do this than what I describe below, but they\n        require add-on software.  The following method should work for everybody\n        who has Windows and an Internet connection.\n\n    </i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n    If you create a <span class=\"tt\">public_html</span> subdirectory of your\n    login directory, give it \"world\" read and search permission, and then create\n    an <span class=\"tt\">index.html</span> file in that directory and give it world\n    read permission, you'll have a home page.  In this example\n    \"<span class=\"tt\">$</span>\" is the shell prompt (yours might be different),\n    and what you type is underlined.  CAUTION: the directory name\n    is <span class=\"tt\">public_html</span> but the underscore might be obscured\n    the underline in the examples below.  Whenenever typing\n    \"<span class=\"tt\">public_html</span>\" always include the underscore.\n    CAUTION#2: Some Web hosting sites might use different a different name for\n    the user's Web directory.\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n$ <u>cd</u>                      <i>(Change to your login directory)</i>\n$ <u>mkdir public_html</u>       <i>(Create</i> public_html <i>subdirectory)</i>\n$ <u>chmod 755 public_html</u>   <i>(Give it world read/search permission)</i>\n$ <u>cd public_html</u>          <i>(Enter the</i> public_html <i>subdirectory)</i>\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n    You only have to do this part once.  Remember, it's <tt>public_html</tt> with\n    an underscore, which tends not to show up when a command is underlined.\n\n<p>\n\n    Let's assume you have created a website in the Web folder on your PC.\n    Here's an example of how to upload your Web files to your <span class=\"tt\">public_html</span>\n    directory on Columbia University's\n    Cunix server using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).\n    First start the FTP program:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n    <i>Start</i>&nbsp;<span class=\"tt\">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<i>Run</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n    and type \"ftp\" in the box.  An FTP window opens and an \"<span class=\"tt\">ftp&gt;</span>\"\n    prompt appears.  Type the underlined commands at the \"<span class=\"tt\">ftp&gt;</span>\"\n    prompt (substituting your own user ID, etc):\n\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    <blockquote>\n<pre>\nftp&gt; <u>lcd Desktop</u>\nLocal directory now C:\\Users\\olga\\Desktop.\nftp&gt; <u>lcd Web</u>\nLocal directory now C:\\Users\\olga\\Desktop\\Web.\nftp&gt; <u>open cunix</u>\nConnected to cunix.cc.columbia.edu.\n220 Cunix FTP server (Version 5.60) ready.\nUser (cunix.cc.columbia.edu:(none)): <u>olga</u>\n331 Password required for olga.\nPassword: <u><i>(type your password here)</i></u>\n230 User olga logged in.\nftp&gt; <u>cd public_html</u> <i>(\"public_html\" with underscore)</i>\nftp&gt; <u>binary</u>\nftp&gt; <u>put index.html</u>\n200 PORT command successful.\n150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for index.html.\n226 Transfer complete.\nftp: 285 bytes sent in 0.00Seconds 285000.00Kbytes/sec.\nftp&gt; <u>site chmod 644 index.html</u>\n200 CHMOD command successful\nftp&gt; <u>bye</u>\n</pre>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n\nThis sends the <span class=\"tt\">index.html</span> file to your <span class=\"tt\">public_html</span>\ndirectory on the server.  You can send any other file by substituting its\nname for \"<span class=\"tt\">index.html</span>.  If you want to send all the files in\nyour Web folder, replace \"<span class=\"tt\">put index.html</span> with \"<span class=\"tt\">put&nbsp;*</span>\"\n(asterisk, meaning \"all files\" in this directory).  Always use binary mode\nunless you know what you're doing.\n\n<p>\n\n    If the \"site chmod\" command failed (this service is not supported by some\n    FTP servers), you have one more step.  Before others can see your web files,\n    you have to give them \"world read\" permission.  Again, log in to the server\n    using a terminal emulator (Telnet, SSH, Kermit, whatever), and:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n$ <u>cd ~/public_html</u>        <i>(Enter the</i> public_html <i>subdirectory)</i>\n$ <u>chmod 644 *</u>             <i>(Make all files publically readable)</i>\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n    Now you have a home page.  If you were at Columbia and your login ID was\n    \"olga\", the address (URL) of your home page would be:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n    <span class=\"tt\">http://www.columbia.edu/~olga/</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n    If you want to add pictures to your Web page, you can upload those too (also\n    with Kermit or FTP), and you also have to \"chmod 644\" all the files to make\n    them readable by everybody.  Every time you add new files to your\n    <span class=\"tt\">public_html</span> directory, you have to \"chmod&nbsp;644\" them so they\n    are accessible, either in the FTP session itself (as shown previously), or\n    by logging in to the host and:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n$ <u>cd ~/public_html</u> (\"public_html\" with underscore)\n$ <u>chmod 644 *</u>\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\n\n    Pictures should be in JPG or PNG or GIF format.  To include a picture\n    (\"image\") in your page, include a sequence like this at the desired spot:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n&lt;img src=\"<i>filename</i>\" alt=\"brief description\"&gt;\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\n    Replace <i>filename</i> by the name of the file\n    (e.g. <span class=\"tt\">skyline.jpg</span>).  Almost every HTML tag can be\n    customized by \"attributes\" in the begin tag.  For example if you want the\n    image to scale itself to the viewer's window (on a computer, cell phone,\n    or other device), and furthermore you want the text of the page to flow\n    around it, you can do:\n\n<blockquote class=\"example\">&lt;img alt=\"brief description\"\n    style=\"width:50%;\n    max-width:480px;\n    float:left;\n    margin:10px;\"\n    src=\"<i>filename</i>\"&gt;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\n    You can look up the attributes in Google, just search for <i>html width</i>,\n    <i>html float</i>, etc.\n\n<p>\n\n    Now you have your own home page on the Web, and your own URL (Uniform\n    Resource Locator, or Web address).  In this example, the URL is:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n    <tt>http://www.columbia.edu/~olga/</tt>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\n    Of course, if you prefer, you can also do all the Web-page editing directly\n    on the server, using an a server-based text editor like EMACS or Vi\n    while logged in to the Unix shell.  In that case you don't need to upload\n    anything (except maybe photos), but then you also need to be more familiar\n    with the server's Unix environment and commands and utilities.\n\n<h3 id=\"more\">11. Where to go from here</h3>\n\nMost Web pages are created by hideous bloated \"Web Authoring\" tools, which\nare usually designed to hook you (and readers of your web pages) into some\ncorporate profit-making scheme.  If all you want is text with some pictures\nand links, some section headings, and maybe some tables, as opposed to\nspinning blinking popup holograms with streaming video, sound effects, etc,\nit's best to keep it simple and do it yourself.  This is how the Web started\noff in the HTML 1.0 days of the early 1990s.  The ingenious thing was that\nit was self propogating.  If you saw a web page with a certain effect and\nwanted to know how it was done, you could simply \"view source\" to get the\n\"source code\" and then adapt it to your own page.  You can still do that\nwith pages that look like this one, but since most Web pages are no longer\nmade by hand, you'll often see tons of incomprehensible gibberish (the more\nspecial effects, the more gibberish), for example\nat <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com\">CNN</a>.\n\n<p>\n\n    Anyway, if you have mastered the simple techniques shown in this page, you\n    know the basics.  Which is more than can be said of many \"web designers\" who\n    only know how to use prepackaged software to create web pages by picking\n    things from menus and moving things around with a mouse.  To go further,\n    you can almost always find out how to do what you want by searching\n    Google (\"html how do I ...?\"), or looking at the HTML code of different\n    websites (browser \"view source\" command) but, again, only for pages\n    that look like this one.\n\n<p>\n\n    Of course HTML is a standard, and here are the official references:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>The\n        <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/\">HTML\n            5.2 specification</a> (2017).\n\n    <li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS\">Cascading\n        Style Sheets</a> (yet another \"standard\" layered on top of HTML, which, like\n        HTML goes through many versions, each one making the previous one obsolete).\n\n</ul>\n\nYou can check the validity of your web page at\nthe <a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/\">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>.\nNote that this page itself does not pass the Validator because it uses a\nnumber of \"obsolete\" elements.  That's because (a) they are much easier to\nexplain, and (b) they still work.  For the first 20 years or so HTML was in\nconstant flux, but with the release of HTML5 in 2014, it seems to be pretty\nstable.\n\n<p>\n\n    If you have made mistakes it will let you know, and if you have used \"old\"\n    or \"deprecated\" HTML features it will let you know that too, and usually also\n    suggest a modern replacement.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fluid\">12. Postscript: Cell Phones</h3>\n\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto;\">\n    The original Web was composed of pages designed to fit on desktop computer\n    screens, which, over time, became wider and wider.  But then suddenly they\n    also had to fit on miniscule cell-phone and even \"smart watch\" screens.  The\n    main pitfall is that an image might be too wide for the screen, so the image\n    width should be specified as a percentage of the viewport width, e.g.:\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n    <blockquote>\n<pre>\n&lt;img alt=\"Brief description\"\n title=\"Slightly longer description\"\n src=\"picture-of-something.jpg\"\n style=\"width:100%;\"&gt;\n</pre>\n    </blockquote>\n</div>\n\nText, on\nthe other hand, usually just flows to accomodate the viewport.  But if your\npage includes text that must not be \"wrapped\" (for example, program source\ncode, poetry, computer dialog transcripts), you have to enclose such\nsections within:\n\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n    <tt>&lt;div style=\"overflow-x:auto; white-space:pre\"&gt;</tt>\n    <br>\n    <i>material that must not wrap</i>\n    <br>\n    <tt>&lt;/div&gt;</tt>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\n    as has been done in several places above, in which case a horizontal\n    scroll bar will appear automatically if the non-wrapping text is wider than\n    the viewport.  If you are viewing this page on a wide screen, you can\n    see this effect if you squeeze your browser horizontally to its minimum\n    width and then scroll through this page.\n\n<p>\n    <i>(End)</i>\n<p>\n    <a href=\"/~fdc/index.html\">Frank da Cruz</a>\n    <br>\n    <i>Page created:</i>\n    1992\n    <br>\n    <i>Last&nbsp;update:</i><!--(or Revised:) -->\n    17 September 2021\n    <br>\n    <script>\ndocument.writeln('<span style=\"margin:0\">[<a \\\n href=\"http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=' +\n  escape(window.location.href) + '\">validate<\\/a>]</span>');\n</script>\n<p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n</body>  <!-- close the <body> begun above -->\n</html>  <!-- close the <html> begun above -->\n

+This page shows how to create Web pages by hand, the original way.  Although
+today most Web pages are created by "Web authoring systems" that are
+designed to shield you from technical details, the fact is that HTML
+(the "programming" language of the Web) is not that difficult, as you can
+see if you follow this tutorial.  To get an idea of what is possible with
+this technique, see these 100% hand-made websites:

 special characters:
 <span class="tt">&lt;</span>, <span class="tt">&amp;</span>, <span class="tt">&gt;</span>.

 <span class="tt">&lt;p&gt;</span>, which is a paragraph separator, or <span class="tt">&lt;b&gt;</span>
 ("begin bold") and <span class="tt">&lt;/b&gt;</span> ("end bold").  So the following
 HTML text:

+
+The first line (<span class="tt">DOCTYPE</span>) specifies which markup
+language the page uses
+(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> = Hypertext Markup
+Language); just copy this line.  The next
+line, <span class="tt">&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;</span>, starts the page
+and specifies
+the (human) language it is written in (language codes are specified
+<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">here</a>),
+and is matched by the line 
+<span class="tt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>, which closes the
+page.  <span class="tt">&lt;head&gt;</span> starts the heading, which
+contains a title to be displayed on the browser's title bar and a
+declaration of the character set (nowadays it should always be
+<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>) and the "viewport"
+line which is a compulsory adaptation for cell phones, "smart" watches, etc.
+<span class="tt">&lt;/head&gt;</span> closes the heading.  The head can also
+contain other items such as style parameters that you can learn about later;
+for example by asking Google ("HTML how do&nbsp;I change the font size?").
+
+<p>
+
+The <span class="tt">&lt;body&gt;</span> tag starts the body of the
+document, is closed by <span class="tt">&lt;/body&gt;</span> tag.
+
+<p>
+
+As you can see, most HTML commands come in begin-end pairs:
+<span class="tt">&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</span>,
+<span class="tt">&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</span>, etc.  The closing part of the command
+has a slash (<span class="tt">/</span>) between the <span class="tt">&lt;</span> and the first letter of
+the command.
+
+<p>
+
+Blank lines and line breaks are ignored.  The browser automatically "flows"
+your text into lines and paragraphs that fit in its window.  Paragraphs must
+be separated by <span class="tt">&lt;p&gt;</span>.  Line breaks can be
+forced by <span class="tt">&lt;br&gt;</span>.
+
+<p>
+<dl>
+<dt><i>Example for Windows:</i>
+
+<dd>Use the mouse to copy the HTML above into NotePad.  Then save the file
+(<i>File</i>&nbsp;<span class="tt">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<i>Save&nbsp;As...</i>)
+in your Web directory as <span class="tt">index.html</span>.  Suppose your Windows username
+is Olga.  Then (depending on which version of Windows you have) this might
+be:
+
+<div style="overflow-x:auto">
+<blockquote>
+<pre>
+<span class="tt">C:\Users\Olga\Desktop\Web\index.html</span>
+</pre>
+</blockquote>
+</div>
+
+Now to see your new web page, just double-click on the Web folder and
+then double-click on <span class="tt">index.html</span>.
+</dl>
+<p>
+
+Now you're ready to start adding "content" to your web page.  Go back to
+NotePad and replace the title and "(Contents go here)" with whatever you
+want.  Any time you want to see the result, use
+<i>File</i>&nbsp;<span class="tt">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<i>Save</i> in NotePad and then
+click the Reload button on your browser.
